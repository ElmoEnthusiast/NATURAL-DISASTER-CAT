<pre>
Get to a high up and a secure location, if you find any items like packaged,
non perishable items, and things like bottled water, take them and stock
accordingly. try to make or find things like life jackets or just anything that
could keep you afloat and hold your weight. Things that are not dense such as 
wood will keep your head above water. If you donâ€™t have any of these items,
remember that the human body can float. Try not to flail around and spread out
your limbs to retain the maximum amount of surface area. If you are stranded 
out in open water, you need to try to get the attention of anyone who may be
around to help. If you have a flare or a flare gun, that would be optimal,
but keeping something like a whistle around your neck will help you carry 
a loud noise long distances with minimal effort.
