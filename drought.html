<pre>
Collect as much drinking water as you can. Consider how much water you need 
daily and ration it accordingly. Never pour water down the drain, even if it
is undrinkable when there may be another use for it. For example, use it to 
water your indoor plants or garden. Avoid taking baths or long showers. For
long term survival, collect any rainwater that falls on your property and 
purify it with either iodine or by boiling it accordingly. DO NOT. I
repeat, DO NOT drink unpurified rain water because you will get sick from
harmful bacteria. One of the symptoms of this is diarrhea, which leaves you 
dehydrated and also requires you to flush the toilet more often. Here are 3
ways to purify water with household objects:

-Boil the water for 3-5 minutes. Let it cool before drinking it.

-Add 16 drops of bleach for every gallon of water. NEVER eyeball it. Bleach 
is a hazardous chemical and is not to be taken lightly.

-If you have Iodine, use 5 drops per quart of water. If the water is cloudy,
add 10 drops.
